# Housing Price Prediction
Based on this [awesome book!] (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)

### Description
The purpose of this project repo is to demonstrate the flow of a typical Data Science project. The overall steps in this project include:

- Look at the big picture & framing the problem
- Get the data
- Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
- Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
- Select a model and train it
- Fine-tune your model
- Present the solution
- Launch, monitor and maintain the system

### Big Picture & Problem Framing
Key questions to ask when starting on a DS/ML/AI project:

1. What is the business objective?
2. How is the output of the model going to be used?
3. Is there a current solution and what are its limitations?
4. What kind of a problem is it - supervised? unsupervised? reinforcement? generative?
5. What performance measure should be used?
